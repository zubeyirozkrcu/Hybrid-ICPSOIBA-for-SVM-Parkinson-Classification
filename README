A Hybrid Optimization Approach for Enhancing SVM-Based Parkinson’s Disease Classification Using ICPSOIBA (Mahmut Durgun and Zübeyir Şükrü Özkorucu)

This repository contains an SVM model optimized with the Improved Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization Improved Bat Algorithm (ICPSOIBA). 
The model is designed for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease based on audio features.

1) Requirements
	MATLAB
	Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
	Global Optimization Toolbox
	Bioinformatics Toolbox
	
2) Data Set
	Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (The dataset can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/174/parkinsons)
	Features: 22 biomechanical sound features 
	Number of Samples: 195 (23 patients, 8 healthy)
	
3) Usage
	Make sure that ICPSOIBASVM.m, optimizeSVMParkinsonHyperparams.m and parkinsondisease.csv are in the same directory.
	Run the master file (ICPSOIBASVM.m) with ICPSOIBASVM.
	
	For which metric you want to run the algorithm, that should be written in the return value of the optimizeSVMParkinsonHyperparams 
	function in the optimizeSVMParkinsonHyperparams.m file. accuracyRate for accuracy, sensitivityRate for precision, precisionRate for precision, 
	f1Score for f1 Score and specificityRate for specificity.
	
	The number of populations was run separately for each evaluation metric as 5,10,15,15,20,25,30,35,40,45 and 50. 
	You can change the number of populations by changing the value of the nPop parameter in the ICPSOIBASVM.m file.
	
4) Outputs
	It outputs the best classification result obtained in each iteration with a total iteration number of 100.

5) Code Structure
	ICPSOIBASVM.m 
		Main script: Manages the hybrid optimization of ICPSO and IBA.
	optimizeSVMParkinsonHyperparams.m
		It trains the SVM model and measures performance with 5-fold cross-validation.
	parkinsondisease.csv
		Parkinson's dataset.
